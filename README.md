# Sequence-Detector-using-Mealy-Machine-
A sequence detector is a sequential circuit that outputs 1 when a particular pattern if bits sequentially arrives at a data input.
* In Finite State Machines(FSM) , sequence detector [roduces a pulse output whenever it detects a predefined sequence. 
* In this verilog code, I have given a prdefined sequence to be detected as '1010' using a Mealy machine. I have provided a 20 bit data in the testbench for checking this sequence in it. 

## Toolchain
* Xilinx ISE for synthesis
* Isim for simulation
